\begin{enumerate}
\item How do tidal forces caused by a body depend on distance and
  mass?
\vspace{80pt}
\item What is the tide called when the Sun and Moon are aligned? When
  they are 90 degrees apart?  What moon phases do each correspond to?
  Which tides are more extreme? 
\vspace{80pt}
\item Why does high tide not always occur when the Moon transits?
\vspace{80pt}
\item What is the tidal period, and why is it not exactly 12 hours?
\vspace{80pt}
\item How does the ellipticity of the Moon's orbit affect the tides?
\vspace{80pt}
\item In what region of the Earth are the tides most extreme, and why?
\vspace{80pt}
\item What effect does the tide have on the Moon's orbit?
\vspace{80pt}
\item What is an umbra? a penumbra? Draw them.
\vspace{80pt}
\item How big is the Earth's penumbra at the Moon's distance? How big
  is the Moon? 
\vspace{80pt}
\item What is the difference between a partial and a total lunar
  eclipse?
\vspace{80pt}
\item How far away would the Moon's orbit have to be for total lunar
  eclipses to be impossible?
\vspace{80pt}
\item How big is the umbra of the Moon at the Earth?
\vspace{80pt}
\item Explain why you can more easily see lunar eclipses than solar
  eclipses. 
\vspace{80pt}
\item Why are there ``eclipse seasons'' each year? How many of them
  are there? How do they change from year to year?
