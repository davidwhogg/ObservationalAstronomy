{Objectives:} To tour the sky and explore the way in which it moves,
using the sky simulation program Starry Night Pro. Check out the
information sheet on SN first, and try some of the controls. The
ability to visit other locations and to run the sky clock as fast as
we choose is very helpful in learning how the sky moves.

\bigskip
\noindent
{\bf 1. Finding your way around the sky}

\medskip
\noindent
Launch SN and check that it is set up for NY at the present time,
pointing South.  Explore the horizon by pressing the N, S, E and W
buttons, and look around more generally by dragging with the mouse
(holding left button down). The stars can be identified by pointing at
them with the mouse cursor. Compare the view with the Mag 5 atlas
(mainly Maps 1 and 6).

The 88 official constellation boundaries, their names, and illustrations
can be shown by using the pull down View menu, clicking Constellations
and Boundaries etc. Within each constellation the brightest stars are
called $\alpha$, $\beta$, and so on through the Greek alphabet
(usually in order of decreasing brightness), followed by the
constellation name in Latin (in the genitive case) or its
abbreviation. Bright stars also have proper names, e.g., Betelgeuse
and Sirius, and these are usually given by the SN pointer. Most of the
constellation figures are based on Johannes Bayer's 1603 star atlas
\emph{Uranometria}. As you look around the sky you will see it is
pretty full of heroes, heroines, animals, and so on.

{\bf 2. Measuring angles in Starry Night}

\medskip
\noindent

\noindent
We shall frequently be measuring angles with SN, and we start here
with the angles between stars which we have seen before with the
celestial globe. Locate the pairs of stars below and measure the
distance between them, to the nearest degree (see SN information sheet
on how to do this). The first pairs are to the South, the others to
the North. Merak and Dubhe are the ``pointers'' at the end of the
familiar Big Dipper, which is part of the constellation Ursa
Major, the Great Bear.  $\gamma$ Cas is the middle star of the W shape
in Cassiopeia. Knowing the rough distance of these stars from Polaris
is useful for locating Polaris when you are outside.

$\gamma$ Cas -- Polaris &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

{\bf 3. Sky motion}

\medskip
\noindent
We shall now see how the sky moves. Return to looking S, set the
time moving forward at a rate so that you can see the stars move (see
SN information sheet). During the night in NY, new
stars come into view, and as morning approaches the sky brightens and
the sun rises.

To examine the motion in more detail, hide the sunlight to keep the
sky dark all the time (see SN information sheet).  Focus on single
stars and examine how they move close to the horizon. Each box below is
10\deg\ on a side and sits on the horizon at the compass points
given. In each box draw a line with arrows to show how the stars move
at these positions in the sky.  In the North also look farther up in
the sky to see the motion around Polaris.


        \begin{figure*}[h]
        \centerline{\psfig{figure={i2s_f1.eps},width=13.0cm}}
        \caption{}
         \end{figure*}


\noindent
Now set the location of the observer (using the Viewing Location display) to a
latitude of +90\deg, the North Pole, and examine the sky motion
there. Fill out the boxes.



        \begin{figure*}[h]
        \centerline{\psfig{figure={i2s_f1.eps},width=13.0cm}}
        \caption{}
         \end{figure*}

\noindent
Change the location of the observer to the equator (latitude 0\deg)
and repeat the operation.


        \begin{figure*}[h]
        \centerline{\psfig{figure={i2s_f1.eps},width=13.0cm}}
        \caption{}
         \end{figure*}



The overall picture should (hopefully) be clear: you appear to live
under a large, rotating, celestial sphere that carries the stars
around. Note too that as you go South, new stars never seen in the NY
sky came into view.

 
\bigskip
\noindent

\noindent{\bf 4. Polaris }

\medskip
\noindent
Return to NY, at the current time, and create an Az-Alt grid in the sky
(see SN Information Sheet).  You will see that
Alt increases from the horizon up, and Az increases Eastwards from the
North horizon point. The vertical lines converge in the zenith (Alt =
90\deg). Check this by looking up with the Z (for Zenith) button at the
top of the screen.

If you start the clock, you will see that the Az-Alt
grid lines stay in exactly the same place all the time, but the stars
move. However, there is one special place, the North Celestial Pole
(NCP), that keeps the same Az and Alt all the time in NY. This is
close to Polaris (and we will often use the two names interchangeably,
although this is not exactly correct).

A key question in understanding star motion is where this special
point is when you go to different places on the Earth?  We have
already seen the rule in class: the altitude of Polaris (or more
exactly the NCP) is equal to the latitude (when you are in the northern
hemisphere).

\bigskip
Check this in NY by estimating the altitude and azimuth of Polaris
from the grid lines:
\bigskip

Polaris:\ \ Alt = \makebox[4cm]{\hrulefill} \ \ Az =  \makebox[4cm]{\hrulefill}

\bigskip
You will also have verified the rule for latitude = 0 in your drawing
of the N horizon picture in section 3.

{\bf 5. Motion in Az-Alt}

\medskip\noindent
It will be clear from the previous sections that not all stars as seen
from NY do the same thing. We will examine 2 examples here: Dubhe (at
the tip of the Big Dipper) and Altair (which is much closer to the
Celestial Equator, midway between the NCP and the SCP).  For each
star, estimate the Az and Alt at 10 or more roughly evenly spaced
positions in its motion (e.g., by stopping the clock and changing the
time in steps of 2 hr by typing over in the display window. Plot the
points on the grids below, and join them with smooth curves with
arrows to show the motion.

\bigskip\noindent
{\bf 6. RA--Dec motion}

\medskip\noindent
Replace the Az-Alt grid with an RA-Dec grid and the celestial equator
(see SN information Sheet). Set the sky turning, and you will see the
moving graph paper in which the stars are fixed.

\noindent
There are some basic aspects of the RA-Dec system that follow from the
geometry of the celestial sphere we have explored above. You can
probably figure them out directly from our discussion in class (e.g.,
using the center, bottom diagram inside the cover of the Mag 5 Atlas
assuming NY is at lat = 40\deg): but
you should also check them on the screen:

What is the lowest Dec of stars visible in NY?  \makebox[4cm]{\hrulefill}

never set)? \makebox[3cm]{\hrulefill}
