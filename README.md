## Notes
Some of the material in this repository is duplicate or out of date.
We have tried to put the out-of-date material into subdirectories named
by the relevant year.

## To-Do items and projects
- Make it so there is a Fall / Spring switch that fixes all Fall/Spring issues?
- Change the names of the different course components to LaTeX macros so the editing isn't crazy.
- Move to modern LaTeX commands for bold and italics and so-on.
- Number the indoor and outdoor labs by separate numbering systems?
- Highlight all changes that need to be made in different semesters with respect to events, planet positions, and so on.
